### Day 6: Create a Subnet in Azure Virtual Network 

The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the Azure cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition.

For this task, create a Virtual Network (VNet) named datacenter-vnet and one subnet named datacenter-subnet within the VNet in the East US region. Make sure the IPv4 address range is 10.0.0.0/16.
