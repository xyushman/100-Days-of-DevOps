## Day 4: Script Execution Permissions

In a bid to automate backup processes, the xFusionCorp Industries sysadmin team has developed a new bash script named xfusioncorp.sh. While the script has been distributed to all necessary servers, it lacks executable permissions on App Server 3 within the Stratos Datacenter.



Your task is to grant executable permissions to the /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 3. Additionally, ensure that all users have the capability to execute it.


chmod 777 
chmod u+x <filename>

user group other 
- rwx r-x r--
  u   g   o
  
| Number | Permission |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 4      | read       |
| 2      | write      |
| 1      | execute    |
