### Day 5: Create a Virtual Network (IPv4) in Azure

The Nautilus DevOps team is strategically planning the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the Azure cloud. Acknowledging the magnitude of this endeavor, they have chosen to tackle the migration incrementally rather than as a single, massive transition. Their approach involves creating Virtual Networks (VNets) as the initial step, as they will be provisioning various services under different VNets.

Create a Virtual Network (VNet) named datacenter-vnet in the East US region with 192.168.0.0/24 IPv4 CIDR.
